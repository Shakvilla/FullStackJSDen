## **What is Javascript Programming Language ?**

**Javascript** was created to add interactivity into web browsers. Before deciding to study Javascript, I recommend that you study html and css, which serve as the foundations of the web. If you don‚Äôt have any prior experience with HTML & CSS, visit the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/) link to get a basic understanding of these technologies.  This definition of Javascript is targeted at people who have no prior knowledge of any programming language. But if you have an experience with another programming language, then I believe the definition below will make much sense to you.

**Javascript** is a High-level, Prototype-based, Object-oriented, Multi-paradigm, Interpreted or Just-In-Time compiled, Dynamic, Single-threaded, Garbage-collected programming language with First-class functions and a Non-blocking Event Loop concurrency model. ( Funny definition) üòÄ. If you don‚Äôt know what some of these terms mean, don‚Äôt worry, I will briefly explain them in a jiffy.

Majority of the websites and web applications that exist on the World Wide Web are powered by Javascript. With the creation of Javascript libraries and frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/), [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/), [TensorflowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/), [Web3Js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/index.html) etc, we can now build Single-Page Web apps, Mobile apps, Desktop apps, Browser-Based games, Machine Learning Modules, and Blockchain Applications respectively. 

## Definition of Keywords:

### 1. ****What Does High-Level Language (HLL) Mean?****:

> A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.
> 

A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilisation. [Read more](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3925/high-level-language-hll)

### **2. What Does Garbage-Collection mean:**

 By default Javascript has functions that clean memory of old and unused memory locations from time to time.

### **3. Interpreted or Just-In-Time compiled:**

The Javascript engine compiles and interprets human readable code into machine code. We will talk more about Interpreters and compilers in the topic *‚ÄúHow Javascript works under the hood‚Äù*

### **4. Multi-Paradigm:**

Javascript has multiple way of structuring and styling code. example: procedural, functional and object-oriented paradigms

### **5. Prototype Based Object-Oriented:**

Almost everything in Javascript are objects except primitive values. Objects inherit methods from their prototypes

### **6. First-Class Functions:**

Javascript Functions are treated as regular variables. We can pass them into other functions, and return them from other functions

### **7. Dynamic:**

Javascript is dynamically typed. Loosely typed. Data types are known at runtime. This could create bugs if not properly done

### **8. Single-threaded:**

Javascript is a single threaded language, which means can execute a task at a time. 

### **9. Non-blocking:**

Takes a long running task, executes them in the background and put them back in the thread once they are done.
