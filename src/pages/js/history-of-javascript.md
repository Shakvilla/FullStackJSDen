## History of Javascript:

To understand what I am about to tell you, you need to travel back in time with me, precisely to the year 1995, when Javascript was created. 

During the early days of the internet, a company called Netscape created a web browser which was called Netscape Navigator. This was soon after the internet was launched. 

Brendan Eich was working at  Netscape at that time, so he was working on a project called Mocha, which he spent 10 days to finish the very first version. The core objective of Mocha was to provide basic interactivity on the Netscape Navigator, Mocha was later renamed as LiveScript.


*[Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International to “standardize the syntax and semantics of a general purpose, cross-platform, vendor-neutral scripting language”. In 1997 was published the language specification called ECMAScript as a ECMA-262 standard. Other browser vendors could use this specification to prepare their implementation.](https://www.javascriptinstitute.org/javascript-tutorial/history-of-javascript/)*

> Javascript was specifically not designed to be the main language that runs within a web page, but to be a kind of glue between the browser and the plugins, such as Java applets that run on the site. The heavy lifting was supposed to be done by the plugin code, with JavaScript providing a simple layer of interoperability. JavaScript did not even have any methods that would enable it to access the server. Another design goal for JavaScript was that it had to be easy to use for non-professional developers. That meant that the language had to be extremely forgiving of errors, and quite lax with its syntax.

But as the web evolved, websites became more complex, people create more web pages with complex interactions on them, then the word web application was coined for this new trend, then came single page applications, developers became very creative with how they developed web applications, and a few years later Progressive Web Applications sprung up and as these trends came up, there was the need for developers to use Javascript even more. Note: Ryan Dahl in the year 2010 launched his project called NodeJS which gave developers the ability to run Javascript on the server, this changed the Javascript ecosystem.
